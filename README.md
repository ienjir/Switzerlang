# Welcome to Switzerlang

## This is my first try at an interpreter.


I started this project with Go 1.24.3 so IDK if it is downwards compatible. If not you either update your Go installation or nuke your OS and install Arch (My beloved) and install the latest Golang version.
My plan is to follow a book I am currently reading and trying to implement what I've learned but make the syntax only use Swiss German dialect as syntax.
